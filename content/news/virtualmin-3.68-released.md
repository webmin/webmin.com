This release adds IPv6 support (on Debian and Redhat-derivied systems), creates sub-domain DNS records in the parent domain, shows the SSH server status on the system informaiton page, makes website options available to domain owners, allows a virtual server to be made the default for an IP, and fixes numerous small bugs.
