This version allows aliases and redirects to be set separately for SSL and non-SSL websites, improves the mass IP address change form, allows the target of an alias to be moved, and includes a Norwegian translation updates (thanks to Stein-Aksel Basma). For Pro users, a single domain can now be owned by multiple resellers, and reseller accounts can have SSH/FTP logins with access to all the domains that they own. You can get the GPL version from the [Virtualmin downloads page][1], or from our YUM and APT repositories.
