### About

The Terminal module in Webmin is a feature that allows you to access and interact with the command-line shell of your server or system directly from within the Webmin interface.

With the Terminal module, you can perform various tasks using commands just like you would in a traditional terminal or command prompt. This includes running commands, executing scripts, managing files and directories, configuring system settings, and much more.
